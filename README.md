# Image-Captioning
Keras implementation of Image Captioning Model. Image captioning is a task that involves computer vision as well as Natural language processing. It takes an image and is able to describe whats going on in the image in plain English

An image classification model based on CNN Algorithm and Transfer learning Algorithm (InceptionNet) was trained on the Flickr 8K Dataset for which the captions were serialized with the name of the image in a new file. 
Text preprocessing was applied on the captions and tokens were generated from the word.Padding of the tokens was created to deploy it on the LSTM model.
